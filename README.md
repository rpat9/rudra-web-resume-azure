Rudra Patel - Implementation of Web Resume using HTML and CSS - Email: rudrappatel@lewisu.edu.

This is a web resume website that is hosted on Microsoft Azure.

# Key Features:

- Includes working links to email, phone number, Linkdin, and Github
- Printable webpage. Use Ctrl + P to print the resume. 

# Getting Started: 

- For this website, I already had a template that I was using. I have my own resume that is approved by Lewis University Resume Services. For reference, it is found on my [Assignment Portfolio](https://rudra-portfolio-on-azure-with-nodejs-atepbua2gtd7ajdm.centralus-01.azurewebsites.net/) in the top bar. 

- After that, the implementation in HTML and CSS becomes easier. Start by creating the HTML and CSS files for this project. Using HTML, create your resume exactly how it is on your reference template. 

- A recommandation for this would be to use nested div element as styling will be easier to mimic a pdf document. 

- When it comes to styling, we want the background to be gray. Then we want the paper to be white. Finally, inside the paper comes our content which you can choose styling that aligns with your template.

- There are some media queries that I used to get the best printable result for this webpage. This was done with the help of ChatGPT. 

- The prompt was simple: "I have resembled this webpage as a pdf. Like a pdf, I want to make this webpage look good when printing. I know that all the content would not fit in one page. So I want everything in Honors and Awards Section and below to be in the second page."

- After implement some or all suggested items that ChatGPT recommends, we are done with the website. This was a simple website that looks like a pdf and is printable using Ctrl + P.
